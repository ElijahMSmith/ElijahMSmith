### Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.

My name is Eli and I'm an undergraduate CS major and mathematics minor at the University of Central Florida graduating in May of 2023.
I'm the projects co-director for KnightHacks and also a undergraduate researcher/team lead at the Wearable Engineering and Assitive Robotics (WEAR) Lab.

I'm always looking for new opportunities, don't hesitate to reach out!
You can contact me most easily at: elijah.matthew.smith@knights.ucf.edu.

Actively looking for software-engineering or full-stack opportunities for Spring/Summer 2022.

My favorite projects from all my repositories, in no particular order:
- WeFEI (WEAR lab project)
- Kronos (ShellHacks 2021)
- Daily Challenge Bot
- BandNames
- Othello

Fun Facts:
- I love all racket sports, except racquetball because it's too scary.
- Florida is my fourth state of residence. Maryland -> Texas -> Pennsylvania -> Florida.
- I enjoy tutoring and teaching STEM to students of all ages.
