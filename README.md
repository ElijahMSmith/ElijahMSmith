### Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!

My name is Eli and I'm an undergraduate CS major and mathematics minor at the University of Central Florida graduating in May of 2023. I currently serve as the president of Knight Hacks and a Tech Lead for the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) chapter at UCF.

I'm always looking for new opportunities. You can contact me most easily at elijah.matthew.smith@gmail.com!

Fun Facts:
- I love all racket sports, except racquetball because it's too scary.
- Florida is my fourth state of residence. Maryland -> Texas -> Pennsylvania -> Florida.
- I'm passionate about teaching and creating opportunities in STEM for students of all ages.
